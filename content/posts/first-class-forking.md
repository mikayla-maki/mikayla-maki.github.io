In my research on blockchains and CRDTs, three related concepts keep re-asserting themselves: User-communities, first-class forking,
and user-accessibility. Most of the really cool and useful shit out there is optimized to be developer accessible, while providing
few or 0 ways to access their capabilities outside of the STEM thought bubble. First class forking is intimately related to the
concept of user-communities. Both need to be made into first class features and there has been little (if any) work to do so.
Examples of first class communities are Reddit & it's subreddit feature. Almost every other social network is individual-first, 
with implicit communities (twitter) and explicit communities grafted on (facebook). Next gen social media, blockchain, and 
organizational tech (CRDTs) need to really nail down this meta-paradigm of communal and individual sovereignty. The freedom to leave
is the most important power of all, and right now it is not reflected in any of our software.
