Mikayla started working in software as a freelance programmer, building WordPress websites for small businesses from 2015 to 2017.

In 2018 she decided to return to school, going to Portland State University and study P2P software, CRDTs, and distributed web technologies with Rust.

As an intern at zed.dev for the summer of 2022, she built the integrated Terminal Emulator, and was subsequently hired.

In her spare time she helps teach high schoolers in rural Oregon the basics of computer programming.
