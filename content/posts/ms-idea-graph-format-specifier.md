In my brain, ideas are embedded in a network of implications, assumptions,
and statements. But it's hard to keep the whole shape of it in my head at once.
I'm much more comfortable relaxing into the stream of inferences and letting
the implications guide me to wherever the ideas lie. But to  become my best self,
I need to start telling people these ideas and engaging in discourses. Otherwise,
I risk letting my own biases paper over the holes in my logic. So, in order to 
properly express my ideas without getting bogged down in navigating the entire
implication graph, I am creating an 'assumption header' which allows me to set 
the baseline context for whatever it is I'm writing. I hope to fill in these
 assumptions with links to the arguments I use to justify these stances. 

It should look something like this:

Assumptions:
* [The sky is blue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_sky_radiation)

As the sky is blue, we could theoretically measure the amount of particulate in the
air by tracking the change in blueness...

Hopefully this works. IDK. We'll see :D
