Existence is philosophically difficult. What if we're all in a simulation? What
if we can't truly know anything? What if nothing we do matters? To cut through
this miasma I choose to put my faith in 3 axioms:

1. Reality exists.
2. Reality is perceivable.
3. Reality can be affected.

Each of these statements bundles in the baseline philosophical claims that I
need to logically convince my brain that it's worthwhile to get out of bed.
Let's examine them.

I choose to believe #1 because it is the safest possible choice. Let's say I
make a bet that reality does not exist. If reality does not exist, then morality
also cannot exist. If morality does not exist, then I can do horrific things.
As there is no reason to not do them. But what if I'm wrong? What if reality 
does exist, does matter, and so does morality? Then my bet has failed to payoff
and I will die, despised and worthless. All so that I can do what, murder people
without feeling bad to myself about it? For my personal tastes, there is much
to lose, and little to gain, ergo it would be silly to do anything but assume
reality, morality, and all the rest are real. This could also double as an
argument for religion; but I will note the 'personal tastes' part. There is
an inescapable value judgement going on here, which is why I say that I take it
on faith. 

#2 was hard for me, I wasn't sure it was even possible to know things due to
cognitive biases and my own autism. I kept looking for certainty and finding 
probabilities. But taking on the axiom that reality is perceivable allowed me to
refocus on what I could do, and helped me train the probability management
capacities that I'd fought against all of my life.

#3 Is trivially true on a small scale given #1 and #2, as you couldn't be
reading this if you had failed to convince yourself of your capacity to breathe.
But trivially true is not enough to inspire action. The world is so huge, the
scale of the problems on this planet, from Capitalism, to Climate Change, so 
enormous, how could any individual's action matter? Thankfully, this is not a
philosophical question, but rather a mechanical one. If we can show that a
mechanism exists to amplify the behavior of any individual to the point where
that action effected the entire world, then this issue is resolved and we can
get on with actually doing something important. Thankfully such a mechanism
exists, [information cascades]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_cascade")
allow the actions of one person to be amplified by subsequent
participants, even overriding their preferences. For a real life, and extreme,
example see
[Mohamed Bouazizi](ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Bouazizi),
who catalyzed the Arab Spring rebellions by lighting himself on fire.

With these three axioms, and the bundle of philosophical claims they imply, 
the fog of epistemic anxiety has lifted for me. I have found myself able to
think and act clearly for the first time in my life. I hope they work for you 
too <3
