Existence is philosophically difficult. What if we're all in a simulation? What
if we can't truly know anything? What if nothing we do matters? To cut through
this miasma I choose to put my faith in 3 axioms:

1. Reality exists.
2. Reality is perceivable.
3. Reality can be effected.

Each of these statements bundles in the baseline philosophical claims that I
need to logically convince my brain that it's worthwhile to get out of bed.
Let's examine them.

First off, reality exists. I choose to believe in this (and not the simulation 
hypothesis, the Boltzmann brain, etc.)  because it is the safest possible 
choice for my values. Let's say I make a bet that reality does not exist. If 
reality does not exist, then morality also cannot exist. If morality does not
exist, then I can do horrific things. As there is no reason to not do them.
But what if I'm wrong? What if reality does exist, does matter, and so does 
morality? Then my bet has failed to payoff and I will die, despised and 
worthless. All so that I can do what, murder people without feeling bad to
myself about it? For my personal tastes, there is much to lose, and little 
to gain, ergo it would be silly to do anything but assume reality, morality,
and all the rest are real. This could also double as an argument for religion;
but I will note the 'personal tastes' part. There is an inescapable value 
judgement going on here, therefore I say that I take reality's existence on
faith. 

Second, reality is perceivable. This was hard for me, I wasn't sure it was
even possible to know things due to cognitive biases and my own autism. I kept
looking for certainty and finding probabilities. But with these axioms, I am
capable of applying deductive reasoning to my day to day life. This enclave of
certainty in my own values gave me the security to face those probabilities.
I've been able to train the probability management capacities that I've fought
against all my life. I've discovered that, while few things are 100% certain,
many are more than close enough for me to be okay risking that 10% or 1% chance
that I'm incorrect. Choosing to believe that reality is perceivable was probably
the most fundamental change I've experienced in the last 2 years.

#3, reality can be effected,  Is trivially true on a small scale given #1 and #2,
as you couldn't be reading this if you had failed to convince yourself of your
capacity to breathe. But trivially true is not enough to inspire action. The 
world is so huge, the scale of the problems on this planet, from Capitalism to 
Climate Change, so enormous, how could any individual's action matter? Thankfully,
this is not a philosophical question, but rather a mechanical one. If we can show
that a mechanism exists to amplify the behavior of any individual to the point 
where that action effected the entire world, then this issue is resolved and we 
can get on with actually doing something important. Thankfully such a mechanism
exists, [information cascades]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_cascade")
allow the actions of one person to be amplified by subsequent
participants, even overriding their preferences. For a real life, and extreme,
example see [Mohamed Bouazizi](ref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Bouazizi),
who catalyzed the Arab Spring rebellions by lighting himself on fire.

With these three axioms, that reality exists, can be perceived, and can be effected, 
and the bundle of philosophical claims they imply, the fog of epistemic anxiety has
lifted for me. I have found myself able to think and act clearly for the first time
in my life. I hope they work for you too <3
